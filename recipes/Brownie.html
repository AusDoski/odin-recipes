    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Impossible Pies are typically desserts that magically separate into layers in the oven, creating both its own crust and a filling. The addition of a baking mix like Bisquick gives the pie structure, so you donâ€™t need to make a separate crust. The desserts, often enriched with buttermilk, coconut, or lemon, became popular in the 1970s, when they were featured on the back of Bisquick boxes.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 bar (4 ounces) semi-sweet cooking chocolate, melted and cooled</li>
        <li>1/2 cup cup baking mix (such as Bisquick)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 margarine or butter, softened</li>
        <li>3/4 cup chopped nuts</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oven to 350 degrees F.</li>
        <li>Grease a 9-inch pie plate.</li>
        <li>Beat all ingredients except for nuts until smooth, two minutes in a blender on high, stopping the blender occasionally to stir, or two minutes with a hand beater.</li>
        <li>Pour into plate; sprinkle with nuts.</li>
        <li>Bake until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes.</li>
        <li>Cool for five minutes. Then serve with ice cream, if desired. </li>
    </ol>
